                <h1>Construction of the RSS Scenes between two vehicles <a name="rssscenes"></a></h1>
<p>The RSS core implementation (<em>ad_rss</em>) proposes a situation based coordinate system to
perform the RSS calculations between two vehicles. This library provides an exemplary
implementation on how a real-world situation can be transformed into such
coordinate system.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This implementation considers neither all possible road network layouts nor all
configurations between two vehicles that may happen. In reality, many corner-cases have to be
considered to cover all of that (e.g. a backward driving car).</p>

<p>In general, the real world road network is far more complex than just one straight road:
the situation between two vehicles is not necessarily unambiguous, especially
as the vehicles can take different routes through intersections. Therefore, the
worst-case has to be covered here, too. All potential configurations have to be
considered when performing the situation analysis and creating the respective
Situation Based Coordinate System. As a result of this there might be multiple
situations at the same time to be considered between two vehicles.</p>
<p>Before the actual road area of the vehicles can be calculated, the type of situation
has to be determined, which is performed within <code>ad::rss::map::RssSceneCreation::appendScenes()</code> as follows:</p>
<h4>Calculate the connecting route</h4>
<p>Based on road network data, the vehicle position and the object position, the shortest connecting route
between these two is calculated (<code>ad::map::route::planning::calculateConnectingRoute()</code>).
To cover also opposite direction and intersection use-cases, the nominal driving direction
on the lanes is disregarded when the connecting route is calculated.
Furthermore, as the map matched positions of vehicle and object might span over multiple
lanes, all possible combinations are taken into account.</p>
<h4>Decide on the kind of situation: same direction, opposite direction or intersection</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If both vehicles are driving in the same direction with respect to the connecting route
a same direction situation is created. This is done, regardless if there are intersections
between the two vehicles present, because one vehicle just follows the other, potentially through the intersection.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img alt="same direction situation" src="../../images/two_cars_same_direction.png" /></th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>One vehicle is following the other on the same road by driving in the same direction: either on the same lane or on another parallel lane</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>
<p>If both vehicles drive in opposite direction and there is no intersection in between an opposite direction situation is created.</p>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Both vehicle are approaching each other on the same road by driving in the opposite direction: either on the same lane or on another parallel lane</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the potential future routes of the vehicles have
to be calculated and combined with each other. As in an AD vehicle the ego route usually is known
that route is taken as basis for the ego vehicle, if present. Every intersection present in both
routes of these combinations might result in a new situation to be considered:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img alt="special intersection situation" src="../../images/two_cars_intersection_highway_entry.png" /></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Besides classical X-intersection or T-intersections also areas where lanes vanish and a lateral conflict is unavoidable have to be treated as intersection cases.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>If both drive through the intersection coming from different intersection arms without crossing routes,
  the vehicles pass each other and an opposite direction situation is created</li>
<li>Else, the routes within the intersection are crossing each other and an intersection situation is created.
  To decide which of the vehicles has priority within the intersection the capabilities of the class
  <code>ad::map::intersection::Intersection()</code> are used. In case of traffic light intersections, the kind
  and status of the relevant traffic light determines the current priorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Handling of similar situations</h4>
<p>The consideration of intersections with all the possible routes leads to an increase in the number
of situations. Therefore, to reduce the computational effort of the actual safety analysis,
within the <em>ad_rss</em> core implementation situations that represent the same scene are merged
if they describe the 'same' situation (i.e. the same route through the intersection).
To achieve this, and still be able to keep the worst case assessment, the distances to enter/leave the
intersection both are intervals to provide the minimum and maximum observed distance to enter and leave
the respective intersection.</p>

<p>RSS incorporates the changes in the road geometries as minimum/maximum length and width
parameters of the respective lane segments into the worst-case consideration of positions and distances.
This makes the vehicle behaving over cautious if the road sections taken into account
are selected unnecessarily large: the more the differences in minimal/maximal width
or length of these segments are the more conservative the behavior of the vehicle gets.
Therefore, the road area for the creation of the situation is restricted to the direct
surrounding of the two vehicles, which is represented by the connecting route as
described in the last section for non-intersection situation.</p>

</tbody>

<p>Nevertheless, the nominal driving direction of the lane segments in respect to the direction
of the road area have to be preserved to allow RSS to decide if a vehicle is driving in wrong direction. The direction of the road area is determined by the driving direction of the vehicles.</p>

<p>Having the situations and the respective Road Area(s) constructed, the vehicle data has to be
converted into the desired RSS object format <code>ad::rss::world::Object</code>. The main aspects of this
are the conversion of the velocity and of the bounding box.</p>

<p>To convert the velocity of a vehicle within the situation, one can take the center point of the vehicle and the vehicle orientation in respect to the road area driving direction
as basis to split the vehicle speed into its lateral and longitudinal components in respect to the borders of the road area.</p>
<p>Having a detailed look at the left vehicle within the above sketched scene. Let it drive with 10m/s
in parallel to the lanes. The split of the velocity leads to longitudinal velocity component of <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">v_{lon} = 10 m/s</span><script type="math/tex">v_{lon} = 10 m/s</script></span> and a lateral velocity component of <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">v_{lat} = 0 m/s</span><script type="math/tex">v_{lat} = 0 m/s</script></span>.</p>

<p>This becomes different, when the lane is not straight anymore. When driving with <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">20\circ</span><script type="math/tex">20\circ</script></span> in

<p>For this, the <code>ad::map::match::LaneOccupiedRegionList</code> with the occupied regions calculated on basis of
the real lane geometries (see <em>ad_map_access</em> for reference) is transformed into the
<code>ad::rss:world::OccupiedRegionVector</code> mainly by:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider only lanes present in the Road Area</li>
<li>adapt the parametric range in respect to the driving direction of the lane segment
  within the Road Area</li>

<p>On the one hand side this step is simple in calculation, but because of the representation of the lane segments within the Situation-Based Coordinate System (minimal/maximal width and length)
and the use of the situation specific worst-case lateral and longitudinal border values of the
vehicles within the RSS calculations, the vehicle bounding boxes are enlarged finally as depicted in
the following image:</p>

<h4>Calculation of Metric distances within the Road Area</h4>
<p>The minimal (maximal) metric position <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">p^{lon}_{min}</span><script type="math/tex">p^{lon}_{min}</script></span> (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">p^{lon}_{max}</span><script type="math/tex">p^{lon}_{max}</script></span>) in longitudinal direction of a vehicle within the road area
is calculated by taking the sum of all minimal (maximal) metric lengths of all previous road segments,
plus the parametric scaled minimal (maximal) length of the first road segment it touches (explained in detail in the subsections below).
Like this, the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\Delta</span><script type="math/tex">\Delta</script></span> of every part of the road segment up to the vehicle is finally incorporated into it's
metric length within the road area <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">l = p^{lon}_{max} - p^{lon}_{min}</span><script type="math/tex">l = p^{lon}_{max} - p^{lon}_{min}</script></span>: The vehicle gets stretched by each of the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\Delta</span><script type="math/tex">\Delta</script></span>.</p>
<p>To calculate the longitudinal distance of two vehicles towards each other the maximum position of the vehicle at the back is
subtracted from the minimum position of the vehicle in front: <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d^{lon} = p^{lon}_{front,min} - p^{lon}_{back,max}</span><script type="math/tex">d^{lon} = p^{lon}_{front,min} - p^{lon}_{back,max}</script></span>
This happens in a similar way in lateral direction and with the distance towards the intersection.
Because the <em>ad_rss</em> implementation takes all parts of the road area into account as
provided from outside (i.e. does <em>not</em> cut-off the road area before the first car),
the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\Delta</span><script type="math/tex">\Delta</script></span> is incorporated as negative component into <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d^{lon}</span><script type="math/tex">d^{lon}</script></span>.
The following Figure provides an example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img alt="Example on restricting the extend of the road area" src="../../images/scene_creation_cut_required.png" /></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Example: Let the actual distance of the two cars be <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d^{lon}_{real} = 17\,m</span><script type="math/tex">d^{lon}_{real} = 17\,m</script></span>. Further let the right border of the road area curve within the intersection be <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">15\,m</span><script type="math/tex">15\,m</script></span> and the outer border be <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">23\,m</span><script type="math/tex">23\,m</script></span>. With the transformation into </em>ad_rss<em> situation based coordinate system the information on the actual road geometry gets lost, so that the difference of the border length of <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">6\,m</span><script type="math/tex">6\,m</script></span> in a road segment at the beginning leads to a decreased metric distance of the two cars of <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d^{lon}_{RoadArea} = 11\,m</span><script type="math/tex">d^{lon}_{RoadArea} = 11\,m</script></span>. Cutting the road area after the (red) vehicle in the back would lead to <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d^{lon}_{RoadArea} = d^{lon}_{real} = 17\,m</span><script type="math/tex">d^{lon}_{RoadArea} = d^{lon}_{real} = 17\,m</script></span>.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To understand the details of why it is important to restrict the road area in its extend,
the actual realized calculation of metric bounding box and metric distances within the road area within <em>ad_rss</em> are sketched in the following sections.</p>
<h5>Metrics of road segments within Road Area</h5>
<p>The overall metric minima/maxima of the road segment at index r (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RS_{min}^r, RS_{max}^r</span><script type="math/tex">RS_{min}^r, RS_{max}^r</script></span>) is calculated by combination of the minima/maxima (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">LS_{min},LS_{max}</span><script type="math/tex">LS_{min},LS_{max}</script></span>) of the contained lane segments:</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RS_{lon,min}^r = \min\limits_{l}⁡(LS_{lon,min}^{r,l})</span><script type="math/tex">RS_{lon,min}^r = \min\limits_{l}⁡(LS_{lon,min}^{r,l})</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RS_{lon,max}^r= \max\limits_{l}⁡(LS_{lon,max}^{r,l})</span><script type="math/tex">RS_{lon,max}^r= \max\limits_{l}⁡(LS_{lon,max}^{r,l})</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RS_{lat,min}^r=0</span><script type="math/tex">RS_{lat,min}^r=0</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RS_{lat,max}^r= \sum_{l}LS_{lat,max}^{r,l}</span><script type="math/tex">RS_{lat,max}^r= \sum_{l}LS_{lat,max}^{r,l}</script></span> ⁡</p>
<p>The overall minima/maxima dimensions of the road area (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RA_{min}, RA_{max}</span><script type="math/tex">RA_{min}, RA_{max}</script></span>) are calculated by the combinations of the minima/maxima of the road segments:</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RA_{lon,min} = \sum_r RS_{lon,min}^r</span><script type="math/tex">RA_{lon,min} = \sum_r RS_{lon,min}^r</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RA_{lon,max} = \sum_r RS_{lon,max}^r</span><script type="math/tex">RA_{lon,max} = \sum_r RS_{lon,max}^r</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RA_{lat,min} = \min\limits_{r}⁡ (RS_{lat,min}^r)=0</span><script type="math/tex">RA_{lat,min} = \min\limits_{r}⁡ (RS_{lat,min}^r)=0</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">RA_{lat,max} = \max\limits_{r}⁡ (RS_{lat,max}^r)</span><script type="math/tex">RA_{lat,max} = \max\limits_{r}⁡ (RS_{lat,max}^r)</script></span></p>
<h5>Metrics bounding box of vehicles within Road Area</h5>
<p>In a similar manner the vehicle parametric bounding box definitions (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">PBB</span><script type="math/tex">PBB</script></span>) can be used to calculate
the minimal and maximal metric position in longitudinal direction of the vehicle within of the whole road area: the minimal longitudinal position of a vehicle (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">BB_{min}^{lon}</span><script type="math/tex">BB_{min}^{lon}</script></span>) is calculated by taking the sum of all minimal metric lengths of all previous road segments, plus the parametric scaled minimal length of the first road segment it touches.</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">BB_{lon,min} = \sum_{r=0}^{i-1} RS_{lon,min}^r + \min\limits_{l}⁡ ( PBB_{lon,min}^{i,l} * LS_{lon,min}^{i,l} )</span><script type="math/tex">BB_{lon,min} = \sum_{r=0}^{i-1} RS_{lon,min}^r + \min\limits_{l}⁡ ( PBB_{lon,min}^{i,l} * LS_{lon,min}^{i,l} )</script></span> , with i: first road segment the vehicle touches.</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">BB_{lon,max} = \sum_{r=0}^{i-1} RS_{lon,max}^r + \max\limits_{l} ( PBB_{lon,max}^{i,l} * LS_{(lon,max}^{i,l})</span><script type="math/tex">BB_{lon,max} = \sum_{r=0}^{i-1} RS_{lon,max}^r + \max\limits_{l} ( PBB_{lon,max}^{i,l} * LS_{(lon,max}^{i,l})</script></span> , with i: last road segment the vehicle touches.</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">BB_{lat,min} = \min\limits_{r}⁡ (\sum_{l=0}^{i-1} LS_{lat,min}^{r,l} + (PBB_{lat,min}^{r,i}* LS_{lat,min}^{r,i}) )</span><script type="math/tex">BB_{lat,min} = \min\limits_{r}⁡ (\sum_{l=0}^{i-1} LS_{lat,min}^{r,l} + (PBB_{lat,min}^{r,i}* LS_{lat,min}^{r,i}) )</script></span> , with i: first lane segment within road segment r the vehicle touches.</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">BB_{lat,max} = \max\limits_{r}⁡ (\sum_{l=0}^{i-1} LS_{lat,max}^{r,l} + (PBB_{lat,max}^{r,i} * LS_{lat,max}^{r,i})</span><script type="math/tex">BB_{lat,max} = \max\limits_{r}⁡ (\sum_{l=0}^{i-1} LS_{lat,max}^{r,l} + (PBB_{lat,max}^{r,i} * LS_{lat,max}^{r,i})</script></span>, with i: last lane segment within road segment r the vehicle touches.</p>
<h5>Metrics distances between vehicles</h5>
<p>Having the vehicles metric bounding boxes within the road area at hand, it is straight forward to calculate the current longitudinal and lateral distances of the vehicles towards each other. Let A be the upper left vehicle and B the lower right vehicle in the sketched road area above, then the distances are defined by:</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d_{lon} = BB_{lon,min}^B - BB_{lon,max}^A</span><script type="math/tex">d_{lon} = BB_{lon,min}^B - BB_{lon,max}^A</script></span></p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d_{lat} = BB_{lat,min}^B - BB_{lat,max}^A</span><script type="math/tex">d_{lat} = BB_{lat,min}^B - BB_{lat,max}^A</script></span></p>
<h5>Metrics distances in respect to the intersection</h5>
<p>The calculation of the intersection distance of a vehicle can then be performed in the following way:</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d_{enter} = \sum_{r=0}^{i-1} RS_{lon,min}^r -BB_{lon,max}</span><script type="math/tex">d_{enter} = \sum_{r=0}^{i-1} RS_{lon,min}^r -BB_{lon,max}</script></span> , with i: first road segment within the intersection.</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d_{exit} = \sum_{r=0}^i RS_{lon,max}^r - BB_{lon,min}</span><script type="math/tex">d_{exit} = \sum_{r=0}^i RS_{lon,max}^r - BB_{lon,min}</script></span> , with i: last road segment within the intersection.</p>
<p>Having the vehicles metric bounding boxes and the distances to the intersection at hand, it is straight forward to calculate the current longitudinal distance of the vehicles towards each other in respect to the intersection. Let A be the vehicle coming from west and B the vehicle coming from south in the figure above with <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d_{enter}^A &gt; d_{enter}^B</span><script type="math/tex">d_{enter}^A > d_{enter}^B</script></span>, then the distance can be calculated by:</p>
<p><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">d_{lon} = \max⁡ (0, d_{enter}^A - d_{enter}^B - (BB_{lon,max}^B -BB_{lon,min}^B))</span><script type="math/tex">d_{lon} = \max⁡ (0, d_{enter}^A - d_{enter}^B - (BB_{lon,max}^B -BB_{lon,min}^B))</script></span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06374">RSS paper</a> is assuming reasonable behavior of
other traffic participants. By the general RSS formulas, vehicles are allowed to accelerate with maximum possible acceleration
within their reaction time. Especially in urban scenarios this can lead to unnecessarily big safety
distances if expecting that fast driving vehicles will accelerate even further beyond the speed limits within their reaction time.
As it's unreasonable behavior of others to accelerate far beyond the maximum allowed speed,
the construction of the scenes with <code>ad::rss::map::RssSceneCreation::appendScenes()</code> supports
to select between different modes to consider the speed limit within RSS accelerated movement,
by setting the <code>ad::rss::world::RssDynamics</code> dynamics accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>None</code>: Do not change the objects maxSpeedOnAcceleration parameter of the RssDynamics</li>
<li><code>ExactSpeedLimit</code>: Set the objects maxSpeedOnAcceleration parameter of the RssDynamics to the maximal
  allowed speed of the relevant road section</li>
<li><code>IncreasedSpeedLimit5</code>: Set the objects maxSpeedOnAcceleration parameter of the RssDynamics to the maximal
  allowed speed of the relevant road section + 5 percent</li>
<li><code>IncreasedSpeedLimit10</code>: Set the objects maxSpeedOnAcceleration parameter of the RssDynamics to the maximal
  allowed speed of the relevant road section + 10 percent</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, this extends the scope of the RSS paper, but might be a reasonable change to improve
acceptance within society.</p>
